# PropTech
My job is to use your data visualization skills, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities
## Use Case
In this assignment we created visulations using Hvplot and Geoviews.
We used resources from San Fransico real-estate data.
We used these resources in order to spot trends in prices per sqr feet as well as gross rent. 
The main purpose of this assingment was to detertime if a one-click buy and rent strategy could be implemented in the San Franciso housing market.
